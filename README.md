# Synopsis
A .NET Core 3.1 Calculator Console Application written in C#. The very first application project I've personally written and published on GitHub. As the repository's title suggests it's a calculator capable of evaluating basic arithmetic infix expressions. By typing or passing your infix expression for evaluation. Rather than clicking GUI buttons on a digital calculator.

**WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT FINISHED! - CHANGES WILL BE _PUSHED_ SOON!!**

# Features
* **Easy**, **simple** and **lightweight** calculator.
* **Basic Operators**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, power of number, euclidean division, euclidean modulo.  
* **Supports Parentheses**: for encapsulating infix expressions.
* **Infix to Postfix conversion**: implements a traditional evaluation process, similar in most reverse polish notation implemented calculators. With an **optional argument** that **prints the created postfix expression** alongside your results.
