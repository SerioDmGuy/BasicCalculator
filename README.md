## List of Bugs
- if you type in anything other than a **number**, you will get a error that basically says it can't convert the string to int because their isn't **one**.
- When the user doesn't give the calculator a **calculate** value listed such as __plus +, minus -, divide / and multiple*__ The program will not spill out a error message and will not **calculate** your number at all.

## Notes:
- Having a go at sorting out the bugs listed above
